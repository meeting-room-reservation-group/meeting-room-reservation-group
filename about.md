In this group we develop together a small application _Meeting Room Reservation (System)_. The idea is to show many steps in blog posts, so everyone should be able start the same or create a own project that provide RESTful API services.


## Project Overview


### Business Requirements

The business requirements will be written down in the form of [Specification by Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) use-cases. These will be written in [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) format. The idea is that everyone should be able to read those _feature_ files. Each feature is explained in one or multiple  _scenarios_. 


### Architecture

All the services will be created in the [Resource Oriented Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture)(ROA) style.
