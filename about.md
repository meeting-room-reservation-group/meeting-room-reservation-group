In this group we develop together a small application _Meeting Room Reservation (System)_. The idea is to show all small steps in blog posts, so everyone can follow all the steps needed in creating some RESTful API services.


## Project Overview


### Business Requirements

The business requirements will be written down in the form of [Specification by Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) use-cases.


### Architecture

All the services will be created in the [Resource Oriented Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture)(ROA) style.
