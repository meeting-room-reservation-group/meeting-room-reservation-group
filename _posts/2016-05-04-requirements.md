Similar as in most real world scenarios, some vague requirements are given.


## The Business Requirements

- For planning a meeting of # persons the system should show the available rooms.

- There are multiple rooms. Each room can have facilities, like computer with small monitor, computer with large monitor, whiteboard, beamer, etc.

- Each room has a certain number of chairs.


## Action Plan

- Try to write down some concrete examples in [Given / When / Then](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html) style.
- Also write down the questions you have, for those cases where there is to less input / unclear input. The above sentences are given in a way a customer could give them. Write down the questions for the customer, so once he answers them, you will better understand the business case.

Try to make good feature(s), with [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) scenarios, containing concrete examples.

In _reference_ we will try to answer the questions.
