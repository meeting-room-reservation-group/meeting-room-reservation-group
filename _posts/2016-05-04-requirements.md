Similar as in most real world scenarios, some vague requirements are given.


## The Business Requirements

- For planning a meeting of # persons the system should show the available rooms.

- There are multiple rooms. Each room can have facilities, like computer with small monitor, computer with large monitor, whiteboard, beamer, etc.

- Each room has a certain number of chairs.


## Action Plan

- Try to write down some concrete examples in [Given / When / Then](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html) style.
- Also write down the questions you have, for those cases where there is to less input / unclear input. The above sentences are given in a way a customer could give them. Write down the questions for the customer, so once he answers then, you will better understand the business case.

In the following post we will try to answer the questions, as well as to come up with some good examples that are  [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) scenarios.
